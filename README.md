## 🦠 Project Overview

**Advanced epidemiological modeling using SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartmental models for pandemic response and policy decision support.**

Developed during Georgia Tech MS Analytics coursework (ISYE 6644 - Simulation), this project demonstrates sophisticated statistical modeling techniques applied to real-world public health challenges, directly relevant to data science applications in healthcare, risk assessment, and policy analytics.

### 🎯 Key Achievements
- **SIR Model Implementation**: Mathematical modeling of disease transmission dynamics
- **Excel Advanced Analytics**: Complex simulation using differential equations and statistical methods
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probabilistic analysis of infection spread patterns
- **Policy Applications**: Decision support framework for public health interventions

## 🔬 Technical Methodology

## 🧮 SIR Model

The model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta \frac{SI}{N} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta \frac{SI}{N} - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I
\end{aligned}
$$

**Parameters:** \( \beta = 0.5 \), \( \gamma = 0.1 \), \( N = 1000 \).

### Statistical Analysis Components
- **Binomial Distribution Modeling**: Infection probability calculations
- **Expected Value Analysis**: E(X) = np = 20 × 0.02 = 0.4 expected infections
- **Geometric Growth Patterns**: Exponential infection spread modeling
- **Probability Distribution Analysis**: 20-person classroom infection scenarios

## 📊 Key Results & Findings

### SIR Model Results (Population = 1000)
- **Peak Infection Day**: Day 24 with 507 maximum infected individuals
- **Epidemic Duration**: ~75 days total duration  
- **Final Recovery Rate**: 99.2% of population recovered
- **Transmission Parameters**: β = 0.5, γ = 0.1
- **Attack Rate**: 99.2% of population eventually infected/recovered

### Disease Progression Pattern
- **Early Phase** (Days 1-10): Exponential growth from 1 to 20 infections
- **Peak Phase** (Days 15-35): Maximum infections around day 24
- **Decline Phase** (Days 35-75): Recovery exceeds new infections
- **End Phase** (Days 60+): Minimal active infections, high immunity

### Classroom Simulation (20 Students)
- **Expected Daily Infections**: 0.4 students per day (E[X] = np = 20 × 0.02)
- **Most Likely Outcome**: 0 infections per day (highest probability)
- **Probability of No Daily Infections**: 67.7%
- **Probability of 1+ Daily Infections**: 32.3%
- **Binomial Distribution**: n=20, p=0.02 perfectly modeled
