## 🦠 Project Overview

**Advanced epidemiological modeling using SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartmental models for pandemic response and policy decision support.**

Developed during Georgia Tech MS Analytics coursework (ISYE 6644 - Simulation), this project demonstrates sophisticated statistical modeling techniques applied to real-world public health challenges, directly relevant to data science applications in healthcare, risk assessment, and policy analytics.

### 🎯 Key Achievements
- **SIR Model Implementation**: Mathematical modeling of disease transmission dynamics
- **Excel Advanced Analytics**: Complex simulation using differential equations and statistical methods
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probabilistic analysis of infection spread patterns
- **Policy Applications**: Decision support framework for public health interventions

## 🔬 Technical Methodology

### Compartmental Modeling Approach

Susceptible (S) → Infected (I) → Recovered (R)
dS/dt = -βSI/N
dI/dt = βSI/N - γI
dR/dt = γI
Where:
β = transmission rate (0.5)
γ = recovery rate (0.1)
N = total population (1000)


### Statistical Analysis Components
- **Binomial Distribution Modeling**: Infection probability calculations
- **Expected Value Analysis**: E(X) = np = 20 × 0.02 = 0.4 expected infections
- **Geometric Growth Patterns**: Exponential infection spread modeling
- **Probability Distribution Analysis**: 20-person classroom infection scenarios

## 📊 Key Results & Findings

### SIR Model Results (Population = 1000)
- **Peak Infection Day**: Day 17 with maximum infected population
- **Epidemic Duration**: ~75 days total duration
- **Final Recovery Rate**: 92% of population recovered
- **Transmission Parameters**: β = 0.5, γ = 0.1

### Classroom Simulation (20 Students)
- **Expected Daily Infections**: 0.4 students per day
- **Probability Distribution**: Binomial(n=20, p=0.02)
- **Most Likely Outcome**: 0-1 infections per day
- **Infection Period**: 3 days infectious period per student
